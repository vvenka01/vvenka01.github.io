    <p> Hello, my name is Vanessa Venkataraman and I am a 5th-year student at Tufts University pursuing my Master's degree in Data Analytics.
        Prior to beginning my Master's degree program, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Community Health and a minor in Economics.
        During my undergraduate education, I was a member of the highly competitive varsity softball team at Tufts, which has taught me a lot of valuable skills and lessons.
        My experiences throughout my time at Tufts have allowed me to explore my interests and passions.
        As a result, I have been able to discover my interest in a career in healthcare technology.
        I am excited to continue to explore this interest as I will be starting my career as a Quality Manager at Epic Systems in September 2023.
    </p>
